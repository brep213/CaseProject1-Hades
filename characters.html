        <p> There are many characters in Hades to meet and get to know. Each one gives you different benefits.
            The ones that help you "directly" during your adventure through Hades are the olympians. They offer
            boons to that help you travel throgh the underworld. There other characters that offer temporary
            boons or improves Zagreus in some way.
        </p>
        <h4>Olympians</h4>
        <p> Besides the olmpians there are the Cthonic Gods and othe important charachters from Greek mythology.
            A way to get items that you can use in every run is by forming a bond with these characters. Each item
            represents the characters in some way. You get these items by gifting these characters Nectar. </p>
