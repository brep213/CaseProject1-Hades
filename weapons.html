        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <p> The weapons Zagreus uses are known as the infernal arms. They are his main way of attacking and can be
            unlocked using Cthonic Keys.
            They can be upgraded temporarily using Daedalus's Hammer (can be found throughout the Underworld). To
            Upgrade them permantely you
            have to use titan blood which can be found by defeating bosses.
