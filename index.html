        <p> Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler (the first one I've ever played). You play as Zagreus, the immortal
            son of
            Hades. The goal of the game is to escape to defy Hades and try to escape the Underworld with the help of the
            Gods
            on olympus, and other important figures in Greek mythology. </p>
        <!-- want to add a trailer of the game -->
        <p>This game can be played multiple times, and every time you play you get a different experience almost every
            time.
            You can use different abilities and different boons gifted by the gods on mount olympus. </p>
